Thanks for checking out our CellProfiler course. We teach this course at the Crick regularly, and sometimes will open it up to outside learners.

There are a few things that need to be downloaded and installed before you get going ont the course , mainly CellProfiler, Fiji and the Course Files. 

CellProfiler:
Please download CellProfiler from the CellProfiler website at : https://cellprofiler.org/releases 
Please download version 4.2.8, and Windows or Mac depending on your computer

Course Files and FIJI:
We have precompiled a version of FIJI for this course that has the plugins needed for the course. It is included as a zip file within the course files. 

The powerpoint slides will help you understand the thought process we use while teaching CellProfiler.  Our motivation isn't to have you learn every single module by heart, but rather, learn how to investigate the modules and figure out which one will be most useful to you for your image analysis problem. We do want you to learn how the basics work, so we will spend a lot of time on Primary, Secondary and Tertiary objects, and relating objects.
