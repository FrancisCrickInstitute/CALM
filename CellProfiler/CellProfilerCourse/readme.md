Thanks for checking out our CellProfiler course. We teach this course at the Crick regularly, and sometimes will open it up to outside learners.

There are a few things that need to be downloaded and installed before you get going ont the course , mainly CellProfiler, Fiji and the Course Files. 

CellProfiler:
Please download CellProfiler from the CellProfiler website at : https://cellprofiler.org/releases 
Please download version 4.2.8, and Windows or Mac depending on your computer

Course Files and FIJI:
We have a directory of course files that will be used in the course. They are grouped by the task in the PowerPoint presentation that calls for them.

If you are taking the course at the Crick, we will give you a precompiled version of Fiji that has StarDist installed on it.  If you are here for fun, you will need to download Fiji at 
[Fiji Downloads](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads). You will also need to add the StarDist plugin, the directions to do that can be found [here](https://imagej.net/plugins/stardist).
