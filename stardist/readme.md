# Intro to HPC and StarDist

__Welcome to the course__

This course is run 2-3 times a year at the Francis Crick Institute with members of the Light Microscopy facility and the HPC team. 
The first half of the course is just intro to HPC. The aim of the course is to introduce users to the cluster computing resources at the Crick, and let them work independently on the cluster. The class is a pre-requiste for the Intro to Machine Learning course, but can be taken independently.  We run both classes on the same day, so the morning will be HPC, and in the afternoon, Machine Learning with StarDist. 

In the _Presentations_ folder you will find powerpoints and pdfs of the presentations made during the Intro to HPC and Intro to Machine Learning with StarDist course.
